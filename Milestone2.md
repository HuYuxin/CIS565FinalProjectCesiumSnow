# Cesium Snow Rendering Milestone2

## Prepared by Anton Khabbaz, Yaoyi Bai, Yuxin Hu

### Overview

In this milestone we added noise to terrain surface normal to get a more realistice snow look. We also tried to implement the snow falling effect in Cesium as a post-processing shader layer.

### Features Implemented

**Adding Noise to Surface normal**

* We added noise to terrain surface normal to get a more realistic accumulated snow look, as described by Ohlsson, P. and Seipel, S](http://www.ep.liu.se/ecp/013/007/ecp01307.pdf)  In their paper, they have proposed a method to generate Perlin noise to normal vector by sampling 3 octaves. We simplified the noise generation process by reading a pixel color from a colored perlin noise texture.

The original terrain surface normal in eye space is:

### Plans for future milestones

* Milestone 3: Integrate the snow particle rendering in Cesium. Make the snow particle render modifiable through the website.

* Milestone 4: ???
