### Overview of Technique
The goal of this project is to add snow rendering feature in Cesium. We approached the problem from two parts. For snow falling particles, we referred to the ray marching sampling method in Shadertoy(https://www.shadertoy.com/view/ltfGzn). For snow accumulation on ground, we applied a Cesium snow material over the terrain. The idea is taken from paper Real-time Rendering of Accumulated Snow(http://www.ep.liu.se/ecp/013/007/ecp01307.pdf). The snow material has a fixed diffuse color, and a fixed specular term. The alpha value of snow material is depending on the slope value of the terrain fragment. We added Perlin noise to slope and normal maps to make the snow looks more realistic. We finally we made the slope and normal maps as a function of time to animate the snow accumulation process.


### Performance Analysis
**Overall Performance Analysis**

The performance slows down when we apply the snow rendering. The bottleneck comes from both snow material and snow falling post processing. We did the performance analysis for both features individually to find out how we could improve the performance.

**Snow Falling Performance Analysis**

The snow falling post processing renders the snow flakes three times with different offsets to achieve anti-aliasing. Reducing the rendering passes will improve the efficiency slightly, but even one pass will slow down the system by 1/3. In each pass the glsl shader takes samples from the graynoise texture for 32 times with different uv coordinates to fill up the screen space with snow flakes. We tested performance by reducing the sampling times. Below is the result:

Clearly the sampling times impact the performance. When the sampling times reduced to 8, the performance could match with the original system performance. However, the snow flakes will not be able to fill up the entire screen space with only 8 sampling times. From the second image above we observed that the texture image size does not affect the performance. Texture sampling part is the bottleneck of the snow falling particles rendering. If we could either reduce the number of sampling, or increase the performance of texture read itself, it would speed up the performance significantly.

**Snow Material Performance Analysis**

Calculation of perlin noise, and reading the normals from normal map will impact the performance. Because perlin noise is generated by adding up noise texture sampling of different frequencies, similar to the texture sampling in snow falling, it could slow down the performance. 

We improved the performance slightly by reducing the sampling times in snow falling shader, and reduced the rendering pass to a single pass because we found the anti-aliasing does not have significant visual impact. Here is our final performance comparason.
